# AE-script

It is designed to save you valuable time and electricity, especially when dealing with extensive rendering tasks in After Effects. If you're not fortunate enough to have a quantum computer, you understand the frustration of waiting for hours for your projects to render. This script solves that problem by keeping your PC awake during rendering and automatically shutting it down once the task is complete.
